/**
 * This class is similar to the original candidate
 * however adds setName, setVote along with 
 * replaceName, replaceVotes and replaceCandidate.
 * As the assessment guidelines I know I was supposed
 * to put the replace methods in the test candidate however
 * I feel as though it's more neat and easier to access here.
